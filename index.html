	<p class="article-text">Using any modern video-editing software, you can make your digital video look like it was shot on a film camera! For this tutorial, you are going to need a video editing software with colour-correction capabilities. The first thing that you should do is to find the correct aspect ratio of your desired film look. There are several aspect ratios that were used during the film-era that were a result of the type of film and type of cameras commonly used. Some examples are 16mm, 8mm, super 8, super 16, etc. If you don't know which camera look you want to emulate yet, a good starting point is 4;3 ratio. <br>
	To crop your video, you can choose one of two ways. First, simply use the cropping tool in your video-editing software and crop the video into 4:3 ratio. The second method is to add black bands around the video such that your typical 16:9 video will retain it's original aspect ratio, but the visibility of the video will reduced to 4:3 by the black bars/bands that block the borders of the video.
	<br>Now, let us begin with the colour-correction part of our tutorial. Film videos from back in the day came in many different flavours, however, the most common flavour of movie film was the super 16 flim from Kodak. This film had a unique warm look that makes everything look nostalgic today. Let's try to acheive that by increasing the <code>warmth</code> in our <code>temperature</code> setting by <code>100kw</code>.
	<br>Great! Although film camera lenses of the day weilded some of the sharpest resolution we've ever acheived even to this day, most home-videos that were shot on super 16 cameras were on the hazy, blurry side. To acheive this look, let's reduce the <code>sharpness</code> setting by <code>20</code> points.
	<br>Nice, we're getting there! Now, to make our video look more authentic to the typical footage shot on super 16 cameras, we're going to have to cut down out frame rate from 30 fps (frames per second), or 60 fps down to 24 fps. We can reduce the frames per second value even lower to 12 fps to make our video look jankier.
	<br>Excellent! Some important details to note for the film videos were the ability of the film to handle dynamic range of light. While most film stock was very capable to handle high highlights and low shadows, most everyday users of these cameras didn't spend too much time to set the correct exposure settings on their cameras, resulting in overblown highlights outdoors in the daytime and underexposed shadows indoors or after sunset. To acheive this look, let us increase the <code>highlights</code> by <code>30</code> points, and decrease the <code>shadows</code> by <code>40</code> points.
	<br>Finally, let's make the video look shaky to emulate the often shaky handheld footage with no image-stabilisation processing. This will be a little harder to follow along as it is slightly more complicated than the steps before, but try to keep up! On you video-editing software, you will a setting called <code>key</code> markers. You are going to have create as many of these <code>key</code> marks accross the entire length of the footage as your computer can handle. Be careful not to over-populate these <code>keys</code>, or your CPU will not be happy. Now, for each individual key, try to set the <code>position</code> setting randomly to the <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>top</code>, and <code>bottom</code> values. Try to keep the variation within <code>10</code> points from the default <code>0</code> value on all sliders. If this method does not work, you can always go the analog way by picking up your screen and shaking it manually before you play the video.
	<br>We are done! Now that you know the basic steps to turn your digital video into a film video, you can experiment with these settings to create your own aesthetic. Have fun!
